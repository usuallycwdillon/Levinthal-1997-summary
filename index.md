## Overview

* A model of organizational adaptation 
  * I assumed that this is an ABM because of the description 
* Pretty rigid (lots of assumptions)
* L's examples
* Interesting because...

## What the Model is About

* Organizations assumed to adapt to fit their environment (or die)
* Survival of the fittest, most adaptable, and luckiest
* Includes a complex adaptive version

---

## Organizations

* Orgs have $N$ attributes
  * Sample model has 10 attributes
  * Initial values are either 0 or 1
* Each attribute assumed to be influenced by $K$ other attributes
  * $K=0$ means each attribute is independent of all others (tightly-coupled)
  * $K=N-1$ means each attribute is dependent on all others (loosely-coupled)

---

## Environment

* Environment is a space with 1 or more peaks
* Number of peaks can reach $2^K$, where $K=N-1$
* Changes in response to number of ``fit'' firms, in CAS version


---

## Adaptations

* In each turn, orgs can alter one attribute to better fit the landscape
* No cost of adaptations
* Assumed that all adaptations are for the better
* Some firms not able to adapt (where $K$ approaches $N-1$)
* Can also change every attribute to random value: ``long jump''

## Experiments

## Results

* Diversity of orgs can be explained by diversity of the environment
* Tightly-coupled orgs are less likely to survive by adaptation: 
  * change in one attribute impacts many others
  * better to make ``long jumps'' in dynamic landscapes
* Loosely-coupled orgs survive by: 
  * adapting quickly (change is easy)
  * making few ``long jumps''
